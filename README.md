## Abstract

This project presents a web-first smart building model that integrates RFID access control, PID-based HVAC temperature regulation, and adaptive lighting control using ESP32 microcontrollers. All sensing and actuation are centrally managed through a web dashboard, achieving <500 ms access response and <1 s environmental updates. A PID-controlled fan system maintains temperature within ±1 °C of a setpoint, while ambient-light-driven dimming automatically adjusts artificial lighting for energy efficiency. Compared to passive monitoring systems, this platform demonstrates real-time, closed-loop environmental control with secure centralized management, validating the feasibility of responsive, fully web-dependent building automation.

## Introduction

Modern buildings increasingly rely on automated systems to manage access control, lighting, and climate to improve security, energy efficiency, and occupant comfort. Traditionally, these subsystems operate as independent units with local controllers and limited integration, making centralized management difficult and reducing overall system visibility. Building managers and security personnel benefit from unified platforms that provide real-time monitoring, historical analytics, and remote control of critical infrastructure.

Existing commercial smart home and building automation products — such as standalone smart locks and thermostats — provide basic remote functionality but typically rely on proprietary ecosystems and distributed local control logic. These systems limit flexibility, make cross-vendor integration difficult, and provide limited quantitative assurance of response latency, system availability, or data integrity.

Our project explores a **fully web-dependent architecture** in which all sensing, decision-making, and actuation are coordinated through a centralized backend. This approach allows precise policy enforcement, complete system observability, and consistent integration across subsystems. The intended users are **building managers and security personnel** who require centralized RFID door access, lighting control, and environmental monitoring through a unified dashboard interface.

**Core Goals:**

1. **RFID Door Lock Access Control** — door unlock latency under 500 ms, with real-time policy enforcement and 100% audit logging
2. **Closed-Loop HVAC Temperature Regulation** — PID-controlled fans maintain temperature within ±0.5 °C of a user-defined setpoint across multiple rooms
3. **Adaptive Lighting with Daylight Harvesting** — ambient-light-driven PWM dimming with manual override through the dashboard

## Use-Case Requirements

The primary use case is centralized building management through a web-based platform. All requirements were identified with consideration for public health, safety, and welfare as well as environmental and economic factors.

### Access Control

| Requirement | Target |
|---|---|
| RFID credential detection | ≤ 50 ms from card presentation |
| Door lock actuation | ≤ 500 ms from initial swipe |
| Credential revocation enforcement | ≤ 100 ms after policy change |
| Access attempt logging | 100% with timestamps |

Safety and welfare drive these targets: reliable, low-latency door response reduces security risk and supports occupant safety.

### HVAC Temperature Regulation

| Requirement | Target |
|---|---|
| Temperature sampling rate | ≥ 1 Hz |
| Steady-state temperature accuracy | ± 0.5 °C of setpoint |
| Dashboard update latency | ≤ 1 s from measurement |
| Historical data retrieval (24-hour window) | ≤ 2 s |

Occupant welfare motivates the HVAC specifications; continuous temperature regulation within a comfort band supports a usable, comfortable environment.

### Lighting and Daylight Harvesting

| Requirement | Target |
|---|---|
| Ambient light update and response | ≤ 1 s from environmental change |
| Manual dashboard brightness update | ≤ 300 ms |
| Daylight harvesting | Continuous automatic adjustment |

Automatic lighting adjustment in response to ambient light reduces energy use and cost while meeting illumination needs.

### Web-Based Monitoring and Control

| Requirement | Target |
|---|---|
| Dashboard data display latency | ≤ 1 s from event occurrence |
| System availability | ≥ 99.9% during operation |
| Unauthorized access rejection | 100% |

## System Architecture

The system consists of four ESP32 nodes and three backend layers.

### ESP32 Node Summary

| Node | Firmware | Sensors / Actuators | Device ID |
|------|----------|--------------------|-----------| 
| ESP32 #1 Room | `firmware/room-node` | BME280, TEMT6000, PWM dimmer, fan relay | `room-node-01` |
| ESP32 #2 Room | `firmware/room-node` | BME280, TEMT6000, PWM dimmer, fan relay | `room-node-02` |
| ESP32 #3 Room | `firmware/room-node` | BME280, TEMT6000, PWM dimmer, fan relay | `room-node-03` |
| ESP32 #4 Door | `firmware/door-control` | MFRC522 RFID, solenoid lock relay | `door-control-01` |

The **same firmware binary** (`firmware/room-node`) is flashed to all three room ESP32s.
Only `DEVICE_ROOM_ID` and `DEVICE_ROOM_LABEL` in `src/config.h` differ per room.

### Layer 1 — Physical Edge (ESP32 Nodes)

**Room nodes (×3):** Each room ESP32 collects environmental data (BME280), ambient
light (TEMT6000), and controls a PWM LED dimmer and a fan relay.  Data is streamed
to the backend via WebSocket every 2 s.  The backend can send dimmer, fan, relay, and
daylight-harvest commands back to the device in real time.

**Door node (×1):** The door ESP32 reads MFRC522 RFID cards and calls
`POST /api/access/check` for every scan.  The backend looks up the card in the
whitelist and returns `granted=true/false`.  On grant, the firmware energises the
solenoid relay for 3 s then locks again.  All attempts are logged.

### Layer 2 — Backend Services

- **FastAPI** (`backend/`) — HTTP + WebSocket entry points for devices and dashboard.
- **MQTT broker** — asynchronous publish-subscribe between devices and backend workers.
- **TimescaleDB** — time-series storage for sensor readings, relay states, fan states, access logs.
- **Redis** — optional cache for real-time device state.

### Layer 3 — Web Dashboard (React)

- Real-time sensor charts per room (temperature, humidity, light)
- Lighting control panel (dimmer slider, relay toggles, daylight harvesting, fan toggle)
- Access control log (card UID, device, result, timestamp)
- RFID card management (register / deactivate cards)
- Analytics (24-hour historical data)

### Data Flow: Access Control Latency Budget

| Stage | Time |
|---|---|
| RFID credential read | ~50 ms |
| Network transmission (Wi-Fi) | ~50 ms |
| Backend processing (DB lookup) | ~20 ms |
| Solenoid actuation | ~100 ms |
| **Total** | **~220 ms** (target: < 500 ms) |

### Security: Mutual TLS Handshake

1. ESP32 connects to `https://raspberrypi.local:8443`
2. Server presents certificate (signed by CA)
3. ESP32 validates server cert against embedded CA cert
4. Server requests client certificate
5. ESP32 presents client cert (signed by CA)
6. Server validates client cert and checks fingerprint allowlist
7. Encrypted session established

**First-connection handshake:** ~100–200 ms | **Session resumption:** ~20–50 ms

---

## Design Requirements

### Access Control Subsystem

- ESP32 must read RFID credentials and transmit over secure wireless with processing and transmission latency on the order of tens of milliseconds.
- Relay driver must provide sufficient current to actuate the solenoid reliably with electrical isolation and flyback protection.
- **Mutual TLS authentication** is required: only authorized ESP32 devices may communicate with the backend.

### HVAC Temperature Regulation Subsystem

- Sampling rate must be sufficient to detect meaningful environmental changes; selected rate is **1 Hz**.
- Closed-loop **PID controller** (discrete-time, implemented on ESP32) maintains temperature within the sensor accuracy range.
- Fan actuator must support variable PWM output for proportional control rather than simple on/off switching.
- Environmental data must be stored for historical trend analysis.

Discrete-time PID control law:

```
u[k] = Kp·e[k] + Ki·Ts·Σe[i] + Kd·(e[k] − e[k−1]) / Ts
```

where `u[k]` is the actuator (fan) output, `e[k]` is temperature error, `Ts` = 1 s (sampling period).

### Lighting and Daylight Harvesting Subsystem

- The BH1750 ambient light sensor communicates over I²C and outputs lux values directly (no ADC conversion required). It provides 1 lux resolution in high-resolution mode across a range that covers all relevant indoor lighting levels, well below the ~10 lux human perception threshold.
- PWM resolution: 8-bit (1/256 ≈ 0.39%, below the ~1% human visual perception threshold). PWM frequency: **5 kHz** (flicker-free).
- System supports both **manual dashboard control** and **automatic daylight harvesting** mode.

### Backend and Communication

- **MQTT** is the primary message broker (10–50 ms typical latency). Selected over polling (500–1000 ms) and Redis Streams (higher complexity).
- **HTTPS** for configuration and policy management; **WebSockets** for real-time telemetry to the dashboard.
- **TimescaleDB** for persistent time-series storage.

### Microcontroller Hardware Interfaces

The ESP32-S3 must support:

| Interface | Used For |
|---|---|
| SPI | RC522 RFID reader |
| I²C | BME280 sensors, BH1750 sensors, OLED display |
| PWM (LEDC) | Fan speed control, LED dimming |
| GPIO | Relay control |

---

## Design Trade Studies

### A. HVAC Temperature Control — Sampling Rate

The thermal dynamics of the model enclosure are approximated as a first-order system with a thermal time constant τ ≈ 20 s (bandwidth ≈ 0.008 Hz). The selected sampling rate of **1 Hz** exceeds the required minimum by more than an order of magnitude, ensuring stable PID control, accurate derivative estimation, and effective disturbance rejection. Higher rates were considered but rejected due to increased communication overhead without control performance benefit.

### B. PWM Resolution and Frequency

- 8-bit resolution (256 steps) → 1/256 = 0.39%, below the ~1% human brightness-change perception threshold → smooth, perceptibly continuous dimming.
- 5 kHz PWM frequency eliminates visible flicker (threshold ~100 Hz) and ensures stable actuator operation.

### C. Communication Architecture

| Architecture | Latency | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Polling | 500–1000 ms (poll interval) | ✗ Too slow |
| Redis Streams | 10–50 ms, higher complexity | Optional / alternative |
| **MQTT** | **10–50 ms, lightweight pub/sub** | **✓ Selected** |

MQTT was selected as the primary broker for best balance of low latency, scalability, and implementation simplicity.

### D. Access Control Latency

Total latency = T_RFID + T_network + T_process + T_actuation = 50 + 50 + 20 + 100 = **220 ms** < 500 ms requirement. ✓

### E. Lighting Sensor Resolution

The BH1750 ambient light sensor (I²C) provides a high-resolution mode with **1 lux resolution** across the indoor lighting range (1–65535 lux). This is well below the ~10 lux human perception threshold, providing accurate daylight harvesting control without ADC conversion overhead. The digital I²C interface also reduces noise susceptibility compared to analog sensor designs.

|---|---|
| Network/backend availability | Stable Wi-Fi (dedicated AP if needed); Raspberry Pi on wired Ethernet; fail-safe firmware (door stays locked if backend unreachable; fan defaults to safe mode from last valid setpoint) |
| Multi-room PID stability | Start with conservative gains; 1 Hz sampling; log temperature and fan commands to backend for offline tuning |
| End-to-end latency | Measure latency in integration tests; add timing logs in firmware and backend; optimize hot paths if measurements approach limits |
| Hardware/integration reliability | Test each subsystem independently before full integration; keep spare ESP32-S3 and critical parts; maintain single pinout and power-rail reference document |

## Related Work

**SmartWatt [10]** targets energy and cost savings through ML-based forecasting and appliance scheduling around solar and grid pricing. Our Smart Home Model treats the building as critical infrastructure — access, environmental control, and lighting are managed through a centralized web-based system, with emphasis on **security, policy enforcement, and real-time responsiveness** rather than energy optimization alone.

Lessons adapted from SmartWatt:

1. **Latency** — SmartWatt reports delays on the order of seconds; we target < 500 ms (access) and < 1 s (environmental/lighting) using WebSockets for live dashboard updates and MQTT for device messaging.
2. **Sensor and data quality** — We use specified-accuracy sensors (BME280) and TimescaleDB for logged, queryable historical data.
3. **Asynchronous design** — SmartWatt experienced UI freezes from synchronous heavy work. We use MQTT pub/sub so devices publish events and the backend processes asynchronously; the dashboard receives updates over WebSockets without blocking.

Commercial products (smart locks, thermostats, lighting systems) typically use proprietary ecosystems with distributed local control logic, limiting integration and transparency. Our project provides a **single, web-first control plane** with explicit latency and availability targets and full observability across access, environmental, and lighting state.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ and Docker
- PlatformIO CLI for ESP32 firmware (`pip install platformio`)
- Node.js 18+ for the frontend dashboard

### Basic Setup (local development)

```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure
cd infrastructure
docker compose up -d timescaledb mqtt redis

# 2. Configure and start backend
cd ../backend
cp .env.example .env    # fill in your settings
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

# 3. Flash room-node firmware (repeat for each of 3 room ESP32s)
cd ../firmware/room-node
cp include/secrets.h.example include/secrets.h   # add WiFi creds + API_HOST
# Edit src/config.h to set DEVICE_ROOM_ID and DEVICE_ROOM_LABEL
pio run --target upload

# 4. Flash door-control firmware (door ESP32)
cd ../door-control
cp include/secrets.h.example include/secrets.h
pio run --target upload

# 5. Start the frontend dashboard
cd ../../frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env    # set REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
npm start
```

Dashboard is available at **http://localhost:3000** in development.

### Running on the Raspberry Pi

The backend and dashboard are designed to run on the **Raspberry Pi** (`smartHome`) so all ESP32s can reach them over the local network.

```powershell
# SSH into the RPi from your laptop (Windows PowerShell / macOS / Linux terminal)
ssh qrytics@smartHome
```

Once logged in, pull the latest code and start all services:

```bash
# On the RPi
cd ~/smartHome && git pull
./scripts/rpi-setup.sh   # safe to re-run; installs system deps + backend/frontend deps
cd infrastructure && docker compose up -d
cd ../backend && source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Then open the dashboard from any device on the same network:

```
http://smartHome:3000        ← dashboard
http://smartHome:8000/docs   ← interactive API explorer
```

See **[docs/RPI_DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/RPI_DEPLOYMENT.md)** for the complete guide including:
- Passwordless SSH setup
- Uploading code via `scp` / `rsync`
- Running the backend as a systemd service (auto-start on reboot)
- SSH port-forwarding to access the dashboard remotely
- Pointing ESP32 firmware at the RPi IP address

### Deploying the Dashboard to Vercel (public demo)

The frontend can be deployed as a standalone static app on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). When deployed without a live backend, it automatically falls back to a fully functional **demo/mock mode** with synthetic sensor data, RFID access logs, and lighting telemetry — no backend required.

#### Step 1 — Create a Vercel project

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → **New Project** → Import `Qrytics/smartHome`
2. Under **Root Directory**, enter **`frontend`**
3. Framework Preset will auto-detect as **Create React App**
4. Build Command: `CI=false npm run build` *(already set in `frontend/vercel.json`)*
5. Output Directory: `build` *(already set in `frontend/vercel.json`)*
6. No environment variables are required — the dashboard defaults to demo mode
7. Click **Deploy**

Note the deployment URL (e.g. `https://smarthome-dashboard.vercel.app`).

#### Step 2 — Proxy from mario-belmonte.com via portfolioSite

Add the following three entries to the `rewrites` array in `Qrytics/portfolioSite`'s `vercel.json`, replacing `<YOUR-VERCEL-URL>` with the URL from Step 1:

```json
{
  "source": "/projects/smart-home-iot-dashboard/smartHome",
  "destination": "https://<YOUR-VERCEL-URL>/"
},
{
  "source": "/projects/smart-home-iot-dashboard/smartHome/",
  "destination": "https://<YOUR-VERCEL-URL>/"
},
{
  "source": "/projects/smart-home-iot-dashboard/smartHome/:path*",
  "destination": "https://<YOUR-VERCEL-URL>/:path*"
}
```

After merging those changes to `portfolioSite`, the dashboard will be live at:
```
https://mario-belmonte.com/projects/smart-home-iot-dashboard/smartHome
```

#### Demo mode behaviour

When no backend is reachable the app silently switches all data sections to **demo mode**:
- Environmental sensor (temperature, humidity, pressure) — smooth synthetic curves updated every few seconds
- Lighting telemetry — simulated daylight-harvest dimmer data
- RFID access logs — seeded with realistic entries (grant/deny events)
- Automation rules — pre-loaded with a default ruleset

The admin panel is accessible with the default credentials `admin` / `changeme`.
